# CS 2316 - Fall 2024 - HW08 MySQL
# HW08: This homework is due by Sunday, November 3rd @ 11:59PM.

# You are required to complete the missing bodies of the functions below.
# Further instructions are provided in the comments ...
# A few tips:
#   - Make sure you return the right value and datatype if a return is required
#   - Test your code for each function by uncommenting the respective test cases
#     in the if __name__ == '__main__' block
#   - Do not import modules within functions
#   - Do not leave any print statements within your functions
#   - Submit in Gradescope as HW08.py - Your submission should be named exactly HW08.py
#   - Print your variables as you code in order to see what values they have
#   - Please make sure that the capitalization of your table and column names matches the
#     capitalization in the database.
